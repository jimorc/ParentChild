# ParentChild
A set of Visual C++ projects that explore ways of setting up parent/child relationships.

There are four projects:

1. RawPointer: Defines a Parent-Child relationship using raw pointers.

2. SharedPointer: Defines a Parent-Child relationship using shared_ptr and weak_ptr objects.

3. UniquePtr: Defines a Parent-Child relationship using both shared_ptr, unique_ptr, and raw pointer objects.

4. BaseDerived: Defines a more general relationship wherein each object may have a parent and multiple children.

Each of these projects is discussed in a separate post on my blog
